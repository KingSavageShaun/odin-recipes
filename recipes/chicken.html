    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Bulgur wheat</li>
        <li>Vegetables of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the chicken breast into a bowl with seasoning of your choice & set aside</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with water & bring to a boil</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add Bulgur wheat to the pot & turn down so it lightly boils</li>
        <li>7 minutes after putting the Bulgur in, add some olive oil to a frying pan & begin to pre heat</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes the pan should be ready. Empty the chicken into the pan & break up any clumps</li>
        <li>After putting the chicken on, take the Bulgur off the heat & set aside with a lid on top of the pot for 10 more minutes</li>
        <li>Stir the chicken every 2 minutes for up to 12-15 minutes</li>
        <li>Once the bulgur has sat for 10 minutes, it can then be put onto the plate</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked all the way through, it can then be emptied on top of the Bulgur wheat</li>
        <li>Use this moment to add any vegetables or garnish to the dish</li>
        <li>Once all the above is done, it is completed</li>
    </ol>
